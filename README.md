# goboy

Developing a gameboy emulator in GoLang. Why? Because I don't know how to.

The purpose of this project is not to develop the most accurate emulator or the most complete emulator or the smartest emulator. Instead, I want to use this project as an excuse to learn Go. I also want to develop a further understanding in computer hardware and architecture, and I don't think there's a better way to learn then to code a computer. I expect this page will grow with my project (which currently hasn't grown at all :)). 

# Resources

I'm going to keep a list of any resources I reference as I think it could be interesting to look back at (and helpful if you're headed down the same path I am!). My reference ethos is avoiding Here's a start:

- OneLonelyCoder's series on making a NES emulator, which you [can find here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8kx56OZQhg).
