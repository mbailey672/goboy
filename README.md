# goboy

Developing a gameboy emulator in GoLang. Why? Because I don't know how to.

The purpose of this project is not to develop the most accurate emulator or the most complete emulator or the smartest emulator. Instead, I want to use this project as an excuse to learn Go. I also want to develop a further understanding in computer hardware and architecture, and I don't think there's a better way to learn then to code a computer.
